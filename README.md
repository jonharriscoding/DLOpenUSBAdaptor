# DLOpenUSBAdaptor
An Open Version of a USB / Serial Adaptor to Communicate with Dragon's Lair, Space Ace &amp; Thayer's Quest Scoreboard Units

THE MAIN GOAL (Dec 26th, 2019)

The idea here is to use an Arduino Uno or Compatable to create a USB Serial Interface for the Scoreboard Unit to the Dragon's Lair Laserdisc Arcade game, and implement a simple serial protocol to allow communication by the Daphne Emulator - However, I don't have the skill set needed to add the changes to Daphne. 

So, I'm hoping once I make this adaptor from the Arduino, support can be implemented into the Daphne Emulator by others.

For now, I'm just setting up the repository with information and I expect to be tinkering on December 30th 2019 through Jan 1st 2020 and getting the connection schematic up.
